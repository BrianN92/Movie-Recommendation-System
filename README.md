# Movie-Recommendation-System

Decision support system (DSS) is a computerized information system used to support decision-making in an organization or a business. It lets users sift through and analyze data and information that can be used to solve problems and make better decisions.

Recommender System is one kind of DSS based on the users’ “rating” or “preference”. It has become increasingly popular in recent years, and is utilized in a variety of areas including movies, music, news, books, research and so on. So, we decide to create a entertainment recommender system to help users choose what they like (movies, musics, ...).
